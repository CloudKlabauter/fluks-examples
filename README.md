# Kalypso Examples

## About 

<a href="https://www.kalypso.cloud/" target="_blank">Kalypso</a> is a platform to design workflows for connecting and automating processes by providing a wide variety of applications and services, including those of the real estate industry. 


Kalypso is based on interfaces we refer to as connectors that allow anyone to become part of the platform. The base of a connector is made up of a <a href="https://docs.kalypso.cloud/docs/partners/connector-definition" target="_blank">definition</a> that describes the triggers and actions of a connector.

In the documentation, we have created a <a href="https://docs.kalypso.cloud/docs/partners/tutorial/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> which takes you through the creation process of a connector.

In this repository you find implementations using this tutorial for connectors in different languages.
## What we're building

In the examples, we have created a connector for a tradesmen service platform which includes a trigger and an action. The trigger informs a workflow that an order has been completed. The action creates an order.
