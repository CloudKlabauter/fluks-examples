# Kalypso Examples

## About 

<a href="https://www.kalypso.cloud/" target="_blank">Kalypso</a> is a platform to design workflows for connecting and automating processes with a wide variety of applications and services, including those in the real estate industry. 

Kalypso is based on connectors that allow anyone to become part of the platform. The basis of a connector is a <a href="https://docs.kalypso.cloud/docs/partners/connector-definition" target="_blank">Definition</a> that describes the triggers and actions of a connector.

In the documentation, there is a <a href="https://docs.kalypso.cloud/docs/partners/tutorial/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> that explains how to create a connector step by step.

In this repository there are implementations of the tutorial for connectors in the different languages.

## What we're building

In the examples, we create a connector for a tradesmen service platform that includes a trigger and an action. The trigger informs a workflow that an order has been completed. The action creates an order.
